“As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others.” 
- Bill Gates </p>

<p>We empower the ‘ordinaries’ - those amateur chefs with unrealized dreams of sharing their love an knowledge of everything about FOOD :)  </p>

<p>Unleashing the wealth of untapped creativity, skills and knowledge; extraordinary food experiences will be created: dinners in total darkness, in total silence, all in red, co-creating a meal, a private Chopped-event…</p> 

<p>It’s the beginning of the end for “restaurants” as we know them. It’s a new era of empowered ‘Foodies’. Created by the masses for the masses.</p>
