“As we look ahead into the next century, 
leaders will be those who empower others.” 
-Bill Gates

<h4>WWe empower the ‘ordinaires’: chef-preneurs with unrealized dreams of sharing their love and knowledge of everything food. 

We unleash the wealth of untapped creativity, skills and knowledge by empowering foodies. Extraordinary food experiences will be created: dinners in total darkness or total silence, all in red, co-creating a meal, a private Chopped-event…

Created by the masses for the masses.</h4>
